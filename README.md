### Thanks and appreciation to

- npm for making their data available to hack on
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/) for providing component screenshot testing
- [Embed.ly](https://embed.ly/) for bringing npmcharts embeds to Medium and Reddit
- All the open source projects that have linked their READMEs' download-count badges to npmcharts üôè

### Instructions to set up project locally

1. Fork this repository.
2. Go to your forked copy of this repository. It will be here: `https://github.com/<your-github-username>/npmcharts.com`.
3. On your PC, open terminal and run: `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/npmcharts.com.git`. A folder called `npmcharts.com` will be created.
4. Run `cd npmcharts.com` and then `yarn`. This will take some time as `puppeteer` will install chromium (150MB).
5. Now, `cd packages/server` and run `yarn` again.
6. Run `cd ../../` and then `npm start`.  You are all set! The project will be running on `port 3896`.

### Testing
To test your code, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3896/chart-image/vue.png. If everything is fine, you should see a chart(takes a few seconds to load; it is normal).

### Hidden features

A few things that might not be apparent just by looking at the site

- Charts can be embedded in Medium articles

- Tweets of a chart should contain previews of the actual chart
